Hi Jiunn Jye, Jason,

Thank you for the update. Since new project creation is on hold, could you please advise if the BYOS (Bring Your Own Script) approach would be a viable alternative for us? If not, what other solutions would you recommend for achieving the same outcome?

Our main requirement is to set up start and stop jobs for a Java application running on a Windows server. Any guidance on how we can proceed within the current limitations would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to your suggestions.

Best regards,
Shashwat
