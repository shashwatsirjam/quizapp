Understood, Iâ€™ll ensure to mark the team DL going forward.

That said, this is an urgent task for us. Since new project creation is on hold, could you please confirm if the BYOS (Bring Your Own Script) approach would work in our case? If not, could you suggest an alternative solution to achieve the same goal?

Our primary requirement is to set up start and stop jobs for a Java application running on a Windows server, and we need a workable approach as soon as possible.

Would appreciate your prompt response.

Best regards,
Shashwat
